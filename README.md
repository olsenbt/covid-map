# COVID-19 US Map

This COVID-19 US Map project looks at COVID-19 data in the US by County. This project contains two maps displaying COVID-19 data by county.

This map shows COVID-19 cases in the United States by County using proportional symbols. The size and color associated with the symbol relates to how many cases were in each county in 2020. To interact with the map, click on a point to see more detailed information about the cases in the selected county.

## Map 2 Covid Case Rate by County

The second map in this project showcases COVID-19 case rates by County per 1000 residents. This choropleth map showcases the difference in case rates for each county. A higher rate of Covid in 2020 is associated with a darker color in the map. To interact with this map, hover over a county to view information about which county is selected as well as the COVID-19 rate per 1000 residents.
